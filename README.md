# Fizz Buzz

This is a basic Fizz Buzz project to play around with new languages.

From [geeksforgeeks.org](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fizz-buzz-implementation/):

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 and for multiples of '3' print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of '5' print "Buzz".
